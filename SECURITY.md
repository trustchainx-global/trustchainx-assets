# Security Policy

We appreciate responsible reports from the security community.

## Report a vulnerability
Email **security@trustchainx.io** with the subject line **“VULN REPORT: trustchainx-asset”** and include:
- Affected repository / page / asset
- Commit SHA or version (if applicable)
- Step‑by‑step reproduction and proof‑of‑concept
- Expected vs. actual behavior and potential impact (CVSS if available)
- Any temporary mitigations or workarounds
- Your contact information and preferred attribution (name/handle) if you want credit

Please do **not** include secrets, personal data, or exploit data beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue.

## What to expect
- We will acknowledge receipt within **3 business days**.
- We will investigate and keep you updated on progress.
- We aim to remediate within a reasonable timeframe and will coordinate disclosure.
- With your consent, we are happy to provide public credit after a fix is released.

## Disclosure timing
Please withhold public disclosure for up to **90 days** from acknowledgement (or earlier by mutual agreement), so that users are protected while a fix is prepared and deployed.

## Scope
This policy covers public repositories under the **TrustChainX** organization on GitHub and assets directly controlled by TrustChainX (e.g., content in this repository). It **does not** cover third‑party services, dependencies, or systems not managed by TrustChainX.

## Out of scope / prohibited testing
- Denial of service or any testing that degrades availability
- Social engineering, phishing, or physical security tests
- Spam, malware, crypto‑mining, or automated scanning that could disrupt service
- Accessing or exfiltrating personal data or secrets
- Attacks against third‑party providers or services outside our control

## Safe harbor
If you make a good‑faith effort to comply with this policy, avoid privacy violations, and do not exploit data beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability, we will not pursue legal action against you for your research.
